# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. yarn add firebase
    add firebase project to your app
`make a project in firebase console we named it as ` # E-com-shopify
2. After we have to implement firebase in our project
3. import these files in firebase.js file that should be available in firebase project!!
4. import firebase from `firebase/app`
5. import `firebase/auth`
6. import `firebase/firestore`
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now connect configuration of firebase by placing object thathas been generated by firebase when you go to project settings
and then at the end just add the line with me
` firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);`
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your file contain two actions and one action can use another 
In this situation we have call that another function with `dispatch(yourAction())` way
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# USE THUNK WITHOUT USING `async` FUNCTION
>It is not necessay to use async when we use redux
>we can make simple function in actions
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GOOGLE SIGNIN
 1. `First import google provider on your firebase file and export it for future use`
 2. `Simply make an action of googleSignin in authActiin File`
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# There should be a way that will check if user is signin or not when page is relaod or refreash ????
**WE WILL DO IT BY USING TOKEN WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN THE LOCAL STORAGE WEHN USER LOGIN** 
 >We have to do it when our app is mount
 >We will do it in component did mount in `<app.js>` file

# FIREBASE AUTH LISTENER
 >`We will make it centrallized state manager who is responsible to amange our state depends upon user esixtance`
 >`Previuosly Every action has access to manage state but now we have the listener to do this job`
